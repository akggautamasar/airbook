# AirBook — Quiz Builder with Telegram Storage

No Supabase. No database. No sleep issues. Just Telegram.

Your quizzes are stored directly in a private Telegram channel. The bot sends each quiz as an HTML file — the channel is your database.

---

## How it works

```
Admin builds quiz → "Generate & Save" → HTML sent to Telegram channel
Students visit /mock-tests → App fetches file list from Telegram → Opens quiz
```

- **Index message**: A pinned message in your channel stores quiz metadata (title, question count, file_id). Listing quizzes is instant.
- **HTML files**: Each quiz is stored as a Telegram document message. Downloaded on demand.
- **Auth**: Simple password-based. No email, no Supabase auth. Passwords stored in localStorage.

## Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1 — Create a Telegram Bot

1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram
2. Send `/newbot` and follow prompts
3. Copy the **bot token** (looks like `7123456789:AAHxyz...`)

### Step 2 — Create a Private Channel

1. Create a new private Telegram channel (any name, e.g. "AirBook Quizzes")
2. Go to channel settings → Administrators → Add Administrator
3. Add your bot as admin with **Post Messages** permission
4. Get the channel ID:
   - Forward any message from your channel to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)
   - The ID starts with `-100` (e.g. `-1001234567890`)

### Step 3 — Deploy to Render

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| **Build Command** | `npm install && npm run build` |
